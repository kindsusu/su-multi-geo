# SEO — Technical Groundwork, Item by Item

Content a crawler cannot read is content that does not exist. One goal:
**everything — body, meta, structured data — present in the HTML received without JavaScript.**

This lane is the precondition for **every** engine. Gemini in particular has Googlebot's index
as its only gateway, so an empty result here means Gemini GEO never starts.

## 1. What the crawler actually sees

- [ ] Do key pages open **without login?** Content behind an auth wall is not indexed.
      If you cannot open everything, at least SSR a teaser (first paragraph, key figures)
      and gate the rest
- [ ] Does the HTML from `curl -sL <url>` contain the body? If it is an SPA/CSR app,
      SSR/SSG/prerendering is priority one — nothing below matters without it
- [ ] ⚠️ **The CSR bailout trap**: even on an SSR framework, certain hooks or APIs can drop
      a whole page to client rendering (e.g. `useSearchParams` without Suspense in Next.js).
      **Re-check representative pages with curl on every deploy** — a sudden drop in body
      text volume is an incident

## 2. noindex accident check (highest priority)

```bash
curl -sL  https://example.com | grep -oiE '<meta[^>]*robots[^>]*>'
curl -sIL https://example.com | grep -i 'x-robots-tag'
```

A staging `noindex` shipped to production voids every other optimization.
Check the **meta tag and the HTTP header — both**.

## 3. Sitemap

- [ ] sitemap.xml exists and is referenced from robots.txt
- [ ] Are **all** detail pages (products, posts, items) in it? Listing-pages-only is a common miss
- [ ] Shard **before** you exceed 50k URLs / 50MB (sitemap index + parts).
      The moment you pass the limit, the whole file is silently ignored
- [ ] When you create a new content type, **adding it to the sitemap is part of shipping.**
      A forgotten type sits outside the index for months

## 4. Meta

- [ ] Title 50–60 chars — **halve it for CJK content (25–30 chars)**: core keyword front,
      brand back
- [ ] Description 150–160 chars — **70–80 for CJK**: a sentence giving a reason to click
      (do not put disclaimers here — it only kills CTR)
- ℹ️ The real limit is **rendered width in the result snippet**, not character count. A CJK
      character is roughly twice as wide as a Latin one, so Latin limits get truncated.
      For mixed strings, budget against the shorter limit
- [ ] ⚠️ Measure **characters, not bytes**. In bash, `${#var}` counts UTF-8 bytes, so one CJK
      character reads as 3 — use `printf '%s' "$t" | wc -m`
- [ ] Must be unique per page — hundreds of pages sharing a templated description reads as duplicate
- [ ] OG image: the face people see when sharing. Per-type dynamic generation is ideal

## 5. Structured data (JSON-LD)

- [ ] Schema matching the page type: Article, Product, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, Organization,
      LocalBusiness (if you have branches or stores)
- [ ] **Must match visible text 100%** — putting content in the LD that is not on screen
      risks a spam determination
- [ ] `@id` discipline: the same entity uses the same @id sitewide. Re-declaring Organization
      on every page splits the entity (a direct hit to the LLMO lane) — declare once globally
      and reference it
- [ ] Validate **after deploy** with Google Rich Results Test or a schema.org validator

## 6. URL and response hygiene

- [ ] canonical: parameter variants and duplicate paths point at one canonical
- [ ] For multilingual sites, hreflang must be reciprocal (one-sided is void)
- [ ] A page that does not exist must answer 404, never 200 — soft 404s eat crawl budget
      for nothing
- [ ] ⚠️ **The 404 bake trap**: in ISR/CDN cache layers, a 404 from a transient failure can be
      baked for hours. On a data-fetch failure, throw (retry) instead of returning 404 —
      "not found" and "could not fetch" are different things
- [ ] Redirect chains within one hop

## 7. Performance and assets

- [ ] Images in WebP/AVIF with explicit width/height (CLS)
- [ ] Preload the LCP target (hero image, fonts)
- [ ] Losslessly optimize logos and icons — a several-hundred-KB logo shipped on every page
      is weight you pay for on every single request

## 8. Indexing acceleration

- [ ] IndexNow: ping new and updated pages on publish (consumed by Bing, Naver, Yandex family)
- [ ] Google does not support IndexNow — compete on sitemap `lastmod` accuracy instead
- [ ] For bulk publishing, **build the ping into the publish pipeline** — a manual ping will
      always lapse
